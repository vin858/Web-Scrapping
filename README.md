# Web-Scrapping
I did web scrapping which gives me data of different papers published in different years on literacy rate and related things. 
Web scraping to obtain a dataset of published papers on literacy rates and related topics is an essential first step in any data analysis project. This process involves extracting data from websites or online sources to create a structured dataset for further analysis. Let's delve into the process of web scraping and how it set the foundation for your exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this specific topic.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing published papers related to literacy rates is a crucial step in uncovering valuable insights and trends within the realm of education and social development. Literacy rate is a fundamental indicator of a society's educational progress and plays a pivotal role in socio-economic growth. By mining data from a collection of research papers on this subject, we gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence literacy rates, the impact of literacy on various aspects of life, and the trends in literacy-related research.

The initial step in the EDA process involved data preprocessing, which encompassed tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats. As with any real-world dataset, it's not uncommon to encounter inconsistencies in data, which needed to be rectified for meaningful analysis. Once the data was cleaned and structured, we proceeded to explore key statistics and visualizations.

One of the primary findings of this EDA was the global perspective on literacy rates. The dataset allowed us to uncover regional disparities, with some regions showing remarkable improvements in literacy rates over the years, while others lagged behind. By visualizing these disparities on maps and charts, we could identify areas where literacy programs and policies have been particularly effective and those in need of targeted interventions.

Additionally, by conducting text analysis and sentiment analysis on the papers' abstracts and titles, we gained insights into the prevalent themes and research areas within the realm of literacy rates. This analysis helped us identify hot topics, recurring keywords, and emerging areas of interest. It also highlighted the evolving nature of literacy research, as new challenges, technologies, and perspectives continuously shape the field.

The EDA on this dataset served as a foundational step for further, more in-depth analysis and research. It not only revealed trends in literacy rates but also shed light on the dynamics of academic research in this field, thus providing valuable insights that can inform policy decisions, education strategies, and future research directions. Understanding the patterns and trends in published papers related to literacy rates is pivotal in advancing our efforts to enhance literacy worldwide and bridge the gaps in educational access and quality.
